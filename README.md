# Python-seed-brute-forcer
I made a small program that brute forces seeds for Python's random module! It works by starting off with the seed 0, then adding 1 to the seed until eventually the desired sequence is given.

NOTE: The python generates a predetermined sequence for the random module's randint function. Making this project work with other functions within the random module will require manual modifications to the code. 

## Seeds:
### Lower = 1, Upper = 10
1: 2

1-2: 2

1-3: 69

1-4: 2387

1-5: 146085

1-6: 365871

1-7: 2799290

1-8: 401991108

1-9: 1361757416

1-10: 5234703478

Pi first 10 digits: 33327794158
