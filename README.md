# Python-seed-brute-forcer
I made a small program that brute forces seeds so that when "randomly" choosing numbers between 1 and 10, will always give a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 in ascending order! May need slight modifications for other numbers, but this is a good starting point. 

## Seeds:
1: 2

1-2: 2

1-3: 69

1-4: 2387

1-5: 146085

1-6: 365871

1-7: 2799290

1-8: 401991108

1-9: 1361757416

1-10: 5234703478
